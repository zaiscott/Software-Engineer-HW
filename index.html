Software Engineer

<p>

Software engineering is a skill and process that requires alot of elements in order to be successful.
Elements such as teamwork, soft skills, and dedication are all needed in order to accomplish the set goal the coder has set.
Teamwork plays a vital role due to the fact the other peers can collaborate and help with any projects and errors one may have in their coding.
Soft skills are parellel with teamwork for the main fact that if an individual is difiicult to work with or has little to none social skills, it slows down the progess of the project one might be working and limits any help one may recieve from an outside individual.
Last but not least, dedication plays a major role in software engineering, because of the difficulty of the projects will be.
if one quits or gives up easily due to the fact that they are unable to solve the problem, they will never be able to solve many problems later on in their work or life.
